# Nethunter Kernel for Xiaomi Mi A2 & Mi 6X

**Kernel Version:** 4.19

**Disclaimer:** I am not responsible for any device malfunctions that may occur due to flashing the incorrect kernel branch. It is strongly recommended to back up your current kernel before proceeding with the installation of the Nethunter kernel.

## Features

You can find a comprehensive list of patches and features included in this kernel under the **Releases** section. The compiled kernel binaries are also available for direct flashing to your device.

## Upcoming Features

I am currently working on implementing QTI haptics support, so stay tuned for updates!

## Issues and Support

If you encounter any issues, please report them in the **Issues** section, and I will do my best to address and resolve them in future updates.

Thank you for your interest in the Nethunter Kernel!
